# FunFramework

What is FunFramework ? It's basiclly a RAT but very simple and fun. This was my first project in batch. 
You can controle a windows device over the network with your phone or another pc.
There ist no installer for this programm so if you need help just hit me up.
Netcat must be installed in windows for this to work.

After you've installed Netcat, just start the listener and connect your device of choice to the backdoor.
If you want this to be more save, use the save_listener script.
To use the save_listener you need to edit the allowed file first with your ip adress, because otherwise
your ip adress will be flagged as unsave and you won't be able to connect to the backdoor.

Another Tip: disable Windows-Defender-Firewall because it might block the port ncat ist operating on.
